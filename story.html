        <p>The above photo was taken in 2013 when we had the pleasure of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Chavez. They are an incredible team; they have been married for almost as many years as the number of wrinkles on their faces and have dedicated their lives to growing quality coffee. To their community they are simply coffee farmers, to their family they are diligent providers, and to us they are our motivation to change the way coffee is purchased. In the current volatile, commodity-driven pricing system, they would normally be paid unfairly as coffee quality is disregarded or even worse when financial needs become more desperate and their coffee is sold for a fraction of their value.</p><p>
Our goal is simple: to establish sustainable trade agreements where we purchase quality coffee to empower farmers and their community.</p><p>

You are also the reason we continue to strive to provide you with excellent coffee. We will also provide you with delicious roasted coffees and the tools to confidently brew your Provision Coffee at home so we can grow in our appreciation and love of coffee together. We believe in community and building relationships from the coffee farm to your dining table.</p><p>

Provision Coffee wants you to make memories around the table with people whom you care about and with a product that is excellent in quality and truly making a difference in the lives of farmers. In addition to purchasing coffee at sustainable rates, Provision gives $2 to the farmers every month when you <a href="../subscription.html">subscribe</a> to a Provision coffee subscription and reinvests 5% of our total profits back to the farmersâ€™ communities.</p>
